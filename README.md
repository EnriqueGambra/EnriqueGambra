## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Checkout my portfolio site at https://enriquegambra.github.io.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on making a Minecraft SMP plugin by utilizing the Bukkit API. I first helped create a plugin back in 2014 which was my intro to programming. Coming back to create a brand new plugin from scratch was something I always wanted to do.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about various AWS services such as Lambdas, DynamoDB and API Gateway. In my day job at Netsmart Technologies we're beginning to utilize AWS services more and more which has allowed me to build new services for Netsmart to utilize.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love working out and I have 4 guinea pigs!
